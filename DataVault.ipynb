        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Wikipedia DataVault modeling \"is a database modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems\". In other words a DataVault is a modelling technique which allows us to import all (structured) raw data into a database without the need to clean or alter the data. The DataVault's main purpose is the store the unprocessed raw data long-term without the need to alter the data once it has been imported.\n",
        "\n",
        "It achieve this purpose all data that has been imported into a DataVault may **never** be altered. Even schema changes in a source system can be modelled in a DataVault without the need to adjust and update historical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important:** A DataVaults purpose is the collect data from OLTP systems and save it. The DataVault is **never** used as an OLTP system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Long-term storage of data - As described in the introduction a DataVault model allows for a change resistent data schema. The schema can handle changes in data, changes in data source and changes in the schemas of source systems.\n",
        "2. Tracking data changes - The DataVault tracks every single data change within a source system even if the source system does not implement a change detection itself. The DataVault not only detects changes but also when these changes occure which make the system well suited if a dataset is supposed to be audible.\n",
        "3. Fast import of data - Another almost accidental benefit of the DataVault is that data can be imported very quickly. Since a DataVault always has a pre-existing version of a dataset, only the changes need to be synchronized leading to a high import performance.\n",
        "4. Changes in data schemas do not necessarily required downstream ETL and analysis processes to be adjusted. - Since the DataVault handles alterations of the source schemas very well, downstream ETL processes might not have to be adjusted. In most cases the conversion of the source data schema into the DataVault schema will swallow all schema changes (while keeping all data) and thereby provide a stable interface for downstream ETL and analysis processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Drawbacks\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not easy to query - The DataVault modeling creates rather complex schemas which make is hard to query data. A simple data table with an identifier and some data will be projected onto multiple tables in the DataVault context. Thereby reading from a DataVault becomes rather difficult.\n",
        "2. Large overhead - As the previous point already leads on, a DataVault is rather complex and has a lot of overhead. This is due to the fact, that the DataVault is meant to resistant to changes. Therefore, relationships, data and identifiers are split into separate tables and thereby creating a much higher complexity than exists in any of the source systems."
